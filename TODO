* IS single personal allowance. We really should have an under 18 amount as well as an under 25 amount. We only have the latter at the moment, and this is inconsistent with our treatment of the lone parent premium, which is lower for <18s. This comment doesn’t apply to HB because under 18s get the same amount as 18-24s
* WTC family element currently includes the basic element. Remove this
* Lots of the maxage parameters for childcare support are < age rather than <= age. The latter fits better with the name "maxage" so change this
* IS/HB age limits are hard-coded – deal with this

CTB
* How are one pensioner one non-pensioner households treated for CTB localisation/cuts?

IT
* Rounding in taper of personal allowance includes hard-coded 52s (weeks per year). Should we use an annualise() function? Or ideally work in annual terms?

Child benefit
* Rounding in taper of child benefit includes hard-coded 52s (weeks per year). Should we use an annualise() function?

UC/CTB
* Decide whether to include UC in CTB taper

UC
* Validate UC when parameters have been incorporated into TAXBEN PARAMS.mdb database

General
* Incorporate asset conditions in benefits
* Code up for 60+
* Employer NI
* Indirect taxes
* NI domestic rates
* Student loan repayments
